# Warframechart (Overall spagetti code, I'll remake it with (Symfony) Api-Platform for backend, and write the front from scrach)
----------------------------
Live: https://warframchart.ct8.pl
**Basic backend functionality**:
- Data collection classes for item prices from https://warframe.market, and https://nexus-stats.com
- Static data collection from Warframe wiki
- Store data in files, database.

**TODO**
 - Adding chat lines to chart;
